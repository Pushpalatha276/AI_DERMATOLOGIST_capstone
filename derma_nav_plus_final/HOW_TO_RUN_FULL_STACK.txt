HOW TO RUN THE FULL STACK (WITH ML API)
--------------------------------------

1) Setup Python env and train model (if not already trained):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install pillow scikit-learn joblib numpy flask
   # Edit reference_dataset/labels.json to map images to classes before training
   python ml/train.py

2) Start Flask ML API (runs on port 5001):
   source venv/bin/activate
   python ml/app.py

3) Start Node backend (in a new terminal):
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   # Backend should be configured to proxy frontend or run at port 5000.

4) Start Frontend (in another terminal):
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   # Frontend dev server usually runs at http://localhost:3000 and proxies /predict to backend.

Notes:
- The backend route /predict forwards the uploaded image to the ML Flask API and returns results to the frontend.
- If ports differ, update axios URLs or proxy configs accordingly.
- This is a demo prototype. The ML model is not clinically validated.
